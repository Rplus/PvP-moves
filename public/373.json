Among the dragons, one of the best is one of the pseudo legendaries from Gen 3: Salamence. Salamence is pretty similar to the OG dragon Dragonite, but Salamence has one of the highest attack stats in Pokémon Go (the highest of any pseudo legendary) and is an absolute powerhouse. However, Salamence isn't too good at taking hits. Any form of super effective or neutral moves can do neutral damage to 'Mence and take off a huge chunk of its HP. So Salamence should always be used wisely. Still, this is one dragon you shouldn't mess with!","desc_moves":"Salamence was destined to be a good Pokémon. With great stats, it was only held back with its moveset until it got Outrage in its CD. The combo of Dragon Tail (its optimal fast move) and Outrage makes it a beast. A single Outrage from Salamence is enough to send many Pokémon packing. Draco Meteor is a nuke. You'll hardly ever find any Pokémon taking a Draco Meteor head on and still surviving (maybe a steel type). Hydro Pump is pretty interesting and has almost the same nuking potential as Draco Meteor (without STAB). Fire Fang and Fire Blast is decent for ice types but Salamence's bulk is pretty low to make too much of an impact.","desc_pvp":"Salamence is a pretty useful mon in PvP but its relatively low bulk leaves a lot to be desired. If you have Outrage, you are going to trouble your opposition a hell lot. With Draco Meteor, you must have at least one shield at your disposal. The other dragons edge out Salamence in PvP due to better bulk and close attack stats.","pve_rate":"5","pvp_rate":"4","trainer":"MeteorAsh15","lvl":"40"},{"desc_meta":"A budget Rayquaza when it has Outrage. It is excellent Dragon counter and is a great generalist for gym battles.","desc_moves":"Dragon Tail & Outrage (Community Day Exclusive), is Salamence's best moveset in nearly all cases. It is a top tier Dragon type, with only Rayquaza being slightly better.","desc_pvp":"It's a decent Dragon type however, it is outperformed by Dragonite (especially legacy Dragon Breath & Outrage), Latios & Rayquaza.
